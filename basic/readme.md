# 1.python不可变对象和可变对象
## （1）Immutable Types：
- int 
- float 
- tuple 
- bool  True False
- str 
- complex  z1 = 3 + 4j, z2 = 1 - 2j, print("Addition:", z1 + z2)
- frozenset
## （2）Mutable Types
Mutable types allow the modification of their contents after their creation. The mutable types in Python include:
- List (list): A modifiable sequence type that can contain different types of elements.
- Dictionary (dict): A key-value pair data structure that can be dynamically altered.
- Set (set): An unordered collection of unique elements that supports operations like addition and deletion.
